				<p>My name is Yusfi Krismon Valas. I'm learning essential Front-End Development and wanted to become a professional Web Developer. I start learning after i graduated from my college through free online course like freecodecamp.org and youtube videos. For me, designing my own page is very interesting. I always get excited when i designing it.</p>
				<p>Being an intermediete photographer is also my next concenr. I like to photograph something that I find interesting. When I see it, I just instantly took my phone and pictured it. So, i decided to presentate my photograph using front-end. I hope you can critisize, either my photograph, my web page or both. Thanks!</p>

				<h2 id="photo-1">Chained Cat</h2>
				<img src="https://i.ibb.co/nchZfKm/cat.jpg" alt="chained cat" border="0">
				<p>This photo was taken in Ngasem Village, Central Java. When I ask my Uncle's brother why is this cat is in chains, the answer is because this cat has beautiful and fluffy hair, and they don't want to lose this cat. I was shocked and said to myself, <em>"your beauty takes your freedom."</em> I asked myself, all the way home when we are born beautiful, Does the world have to be this cruel? We don't ask to be born beautiful. Does God love us with that? does God test us? Is fate fair? But if everyone thinks fate is unfair, doesn't that mean fate is fair to everyone? As my wild thoughts unfolded, my warm home awaited me, waiting for me to share my restlessness with her, and contemplate it under a simple roof.</p>

				<h2>Di Barat Jatinegara</h2>
				<img src="https://i.ibb.co/bXyRvMb/Jatinegara.jpg" alt="Jatinegara" border="0">
				<p>This photo was taken in Jatinegara Railway Station, Jakarta, at 2 am. After we exit from the West Gate, we will see a pedestrian bridge. We can see local community activities early in the morning. There is public transportation waiting for passengers, someone had just come from a long journey to meet his beloved family, and the Transjakarta route, which is empty, because Transjakarta only operates at 7 am.</p>

				<h2>Gerbang Candramawa</h2>
				<img src="https://i.ibb.co/zPg0DGg/Gate.jpg" alt="Gate" border="0">
				<p>This photo was taken in Ambarawa, Semarang, Central Java. <em>"Gerbang"</em> means "Gate," and <em>"Candramawa"</em> means "black and white," usually about cat hair color. This gate has fond memories in my life. As a child, I used to play with friends in the small alley area near my house in Ambarawa, where this gate is located. When leaving for Friday prayers, my brothers and I also passed through this gate. It's compassionate to see this homely gate, never changing, and still my best place to reminisce.</p>
				<p>I make this picture black and white and named it <em>"Gerbang Candramawa"</em> because I also wanted to bring up beautiful Indonesian words. Many people don't know that Bahasa has many beautiful words, Like <em>Arunika</em>, <em>Candramawa</em>, <em>Nayanika</em>, and much more. So, I decided to introduce these beautiful words through photography. </p>
